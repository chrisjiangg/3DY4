## From RF Data to Mono Audio

The main objective of this 3DY4 lab is to understand how to use signal-flow graphs to model a real-life radio application in software. The case study concerns processing RF data from an FM channel to produce mono audio.

The specific details are in the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab3.pdf), and the start-up code from the [model](model/) and [src](src/) sub-folders.

Both the in-lab experiments and the take-home exercises are due 16 hours before your next lab is scheduled.
