## Code Optimization

The main objective of this 3DY4 lab is to learn about code optimization, as well as how to benchmark and unit test refactored code.

The start-up code from the [model](model/) and [src](src/) sub-folders is almost the same as the code from the previous lab (with a few differences highlighted in the Appendix of the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab4.pdf)). The main additions are the [bench](bench/) and [test](test/) sub-folders.

To get started, check the Appendix from the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab4.pdf) or the [flow](doc/cmake-build-flow.md) overview. If you need to build the executables in debug mode, refer to the [debug](doc/cmake-build-debug.md) overview.

Both the in-lab experiments and the take-home exercises are due 16 hours before your next lab session (lab cross-exam) is scheduled.
