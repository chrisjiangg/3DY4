## 🧪 **Labs Overview**

### 🔹 **Lab 1 – Sampling and Data Acquisition**  
Developed C++ code to sample analog signals and store them for analysis.  
Implemented timing loops, memory management, and signal file generation.

### 🔹 **Lab 2 – Signal Filtering and Spectral Analysis**  
Designed low-pass and band-pass filters in C++ and Python.  
Analyzed signals using FFTs and plotted results with Gnuplot to visualize frequency characteristics.

### 🔹 **Lab 3 – Real-Time Scheduling**  
Implemented and tested Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).  
Measured response times and evaluated schedulability under various task sets.

### 🔹 **Lab 4 – System Modeling and Response Analysis**  
Used Python and control libraries to model dynamic systems.  
Analyzed system stability, poles/zeros, and step responses using second-order systems.
